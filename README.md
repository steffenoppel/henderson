# Henderson rat analysis
Analyses from the Henderson Island expedition May - November 2015. Aims to estimate density, survival, and home range of Pacific rats based on spatial mark-recapture data of 7 primary sessions with 10 secondary sessions each. Analyses based on variour SECR models, including opne robust-design, single-session, CJS and JS models.
MAIN PROBLEM: robust-design CJS does not converge, robust-design JS requires too much memory because state-space is very large; single session CJS produces unrealistic survival parameters.
